### What Approaches Are There? ðŸš€

To achieve your goals, it is necessary to write them down.
The simplest approach is to formulate a goal using the **SMART formula**.
However, there are also other approaches that anchor the set goal in different ways.
An interesting approach here is **visualization**, which involves imagining the end state when reaching the goal.
Another approach is to formulate a **"why"**, a deep reason why the goal is important to you.

It makes sense to explore the various approaches and try them out for yourself.
To achieve your own goals, it is necessary to engage with them.
If you don't know what you want to achieve and why, you won't achieve it either.

Furthermore, I would like to present to you my own approach to how I set my goals, how I stay motivated, and why a larger vision plays a role in this.

### My Approach: 3 Steps ðŸ¥‡
First Step: Formulate a **larger vision**.
A vision is a formulation that I define through three criteria: **Material, Emotions, and Values**.
A vision relates to material desires (money, house, car), emotional anchoring (family, partner), and personal values (peace, tranquility).
A vision is part of a larger strategy.
The **strategy** takes shape through a **10-, 5-, 3-, 2-, and 1-year vision**.


Second Step: Based on this, a goal is formulated that takes a small step towards the next vision.
A **goal** is limited to **one task** and a duration of **one week**.
Only one goal should be formulated per week, and time should be blocked out in the calendar beforehand.

Third Step: Execute the weekly goal week for week. 
You can use my tool [Goalkeepr.io](https://goalkeepr.io/en) where You can store your visions and weekly goals.

This approach has the advantage of **achieving your higher vision through consistency**.
Consistency and discipline are the keys to your goals; in my opinion, there is no other way.
