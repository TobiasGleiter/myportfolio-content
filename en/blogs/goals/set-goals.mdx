### What Approaches Are There? ðŸš€

To achieve your goals, it is necessary to write them down.
The simplest approach is to formulate a goal using the **SMART formula**.
However, there are also other approaches that anchor the set goal in different ways.
An interesting approach here is **visualization**, imagining the end state upon reaching the goal.
Another approach is formulating a **"why"**, a deep reason why the goal is important to you.

Furthermore, I would like to present my own approach to you, how I set my goals, how I stay motivated, and why a larger vision plays a role in this.

### My Approach: 3 Steps ðŸ¥‡

**Step One**: Formulating a **larger vision**.
A vision is a formulation that I define through three criteria: **Material, Emotional, and Values**.
A vision relates to material desires (money, house, car, ...), emotional anchoring (family, spouse/partner, ...), and personal values (peace, freedom, independence, ...).
A single vision is a part of a larger strategy.
This **strategy** is formed through a **10-, 5-, 3-, 2-, and 1-year vision**.
You can gradually formulate the visions from the three criteria: Material, Emotional, and Values.
Start with the 10-year vision as big as possible and then reduce your individual visions to the 1-year vision.

**Step Two**: Based on this, a goal is formulated that takes you a small step closer to the next vision.
A **goal** is limited to **one task** and the duration of **one week**.
You can use the SMART formula to define the goal.
It is important that there is only one goal per week, and you learn to focus on achieving this goal.
Tip: Plan fixed hours in the week for this task and organize all other appointments around it.

**Step Three**: Consistently pursue the weekly goal week after week.
It is not only about achieving the goals but also about making it clear to yourself that you can and will achieve the goals every week.
Here, a small micro-shift also begins.
You teach yourself to set goals anew and to actually achieve them.

### Conclusion ðŸ“¬

No matter which approach you follow, it is the right one because you engage with your goals and allow yourself to make mistakes.
So, it is important that you engage with your goals, try out different methods, and find out how you can achieve what you want.
When the goal is clear, it is easier to achieve it.
That's why I believe that a larger vision helps to maintain focus in everyday life.

I find that this approach with five visions and one goal at a time is a very simple yet efficient approach.
You learn how to reduce your goals and how to consistently work on them instead of trying to accomplish everything at once and then giving up early.
However, it depends on where you are in your goal setting, how disciplined you are, and what you want to achieve.
